Welcome to The Lab,

My goal with this project was to build a website using DJANGO with funtionality of an online store, blog and membership options available. I wanted to provide functions which allows users to add, edit, and delete. I wanted to build a website for a gym which provides various exercise classes , showing timetables of classes and brief descriptions of the classes on offer. The store shows exercise equipment for sale and allows purchases. In addition users can complete membership on the website with monthly and annual options available.

When it comes to shopping on the web, users need to feel safe & comfortable in order for them to actually go through with purchases online. Therefore providing the best UX, proper authentication and using secure payment gateways (in this case Stripe) is necessary to offer the best solution.

Thank you for visiting my Github page. I hope you enjoy reading about the project below. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions. You can message me through my Github page.

#### Icons:

All icons used in the site were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

#### Images:

All background and images were taken from [freepick](https://www.freepik.com/) and [shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/modern-gym-interior-equipmentfilter-image-414548209). I used the [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) to edit the images for their own purposes.

#### Colours:

I used [this](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/42360) colour palette from color-hex.com.

## Wireframes: üõ† 

All wireframes were designed and produced using [Balsamiq Mockups 3](https://balsamiq.com/). link to my [Wireframes](https://github.com/johndbigboi/The-Fitness-Lab/tree/master/wireframes). The Original design of the wireframe was altered as i focus on what is the best design for each django app.  

## Database Design: ‚öôÔ∏è

* During development of The LAB I worked with the standard <strong>sqlite3</strong>, database that comes installed with Django.
* In the production version of The LAB the database is a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, hosted and provided by Heroku.
* The The LAB development flowchart can be viewed [here](https://github.com/johndbigboi/The-Fitness-Lab/blob/master/wireframes/flowchart.png).
* I added Blog and Membership app which is not included in the flowchart.

#### The Blog Model:

The Post model within the Blog app holds the following data for the Blog post.

## Planning and Testing: üìù

As I planned and developed this website using Python, SQlite3 and PostgreSQL database, I planned throughly and tested every line of the codes and made sure the codes were functioning properly, looking for errors and adjusting until the code ran without any issues. This process allowed me to learn more in depth on how to work codes with Python, SQlite3 and PostgreSQL database. 

### Feature Testing: üé° 


<strong>Blog Post</strong>

* <strong>Plan: üìù</strong>  The user needs to register first to have full access and be able to submit, edit and leave commments. A guest user can only read the blogs.

* <strong>Implementation: üè≠</strong> Using a Post model which a registered member only can send blog post and able to edit.

* <strong>Test: üß™</strong> To test this feature, I had to create several accounts in order to test the registration process as planned, checking the values were passed & stored in the database. Using the registered account, by logging in and out was found to be succesful.

* <strong>Result: üèÜ</strong> The test passed as the created test user accounts are stored in the database with encrypted passwords and the user can login and log out of sessions without problems.

* <strong>Verdict: ‚úÖ</strong>  This test has passed based on the above criteria and notes.

<strong>Gym Membership</strong>

* <strong>Plan: üìù</strong>  The registered user can choose two type of membership and get the start and end date of the subscription

* <strong>Implementation: üè≠</strong>  To implement this feature, I needed to use the the request session in the database and save the choosen membership type for each member, and then save it in their profile page to view the start and end dates of the subscription. 

* <strong>Test: üß™</strong>  To test this feature, I purchase the membership and choose a start and end date.

* <strong>Result: üèÜ</strong>  The test passed for every purchased and subscribe made.

* <strong>Verdict: ‚úÖ</strong>  This test was passed based on the above criteria and notes.

<strong>Checkout using STRIPE</strong>

* <strong>Plan: üìù</strong> The User able to purchase a product from the shop e-commerce page. Handling sensitive information and keeping the privacy and integrity of the service within the legal guidelines. This feature needed to work seemlessly so that the user is informed as much as possible during the payment process.

* <strong>Implementation: üè≠</strong> To implement this feature, I use and follow the course material supplied by Code Institute aswell as the Django & stripe documentation. I created a model with Order and OrderItem pass it on the view.py and render to the template page. A validiation from STRIPE using stripe.js to process the payment succesfully.
* <strong>Test: üß™</strong>  To test this feature, i created few purchases which i submitted and was successful.

* <strong>Result: üèÜ</strong>  The test passed for every Purchase operation I carried out.

* <strong>Verdict: ‚úÖ</strong> This test was passed based on the above criteria and notes.

<strong>Profile Dashboard</strong>

* <strong>Plan: üìù</strong> A dashboard with all the needed information of the user, Information as order history, membership access and editable profile information.

* <strong>Implementation: üè≠</strong> To implement this feature, I created an account app which is connected as user to the Blog, Membership, and order history. All the user interactions was save in the database and can be pulled to be used in the account app and render in the profile dashboard page.

* <strong>Test: üß™</strong>  To test this feature, I created few User and test every function of the website and view the profile information in the dashboard.

* <strong>Result: üèÜ</strong> The test passed for every user operation I carried out.

* <strong>Verdict: ‚úÖ</strong> This test was passed based on the above criteria and notes.


### Validators and linters:

* The HTML code was validated with: [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)
* The CSS code was validated with:[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
* CSS Lint VSCode extension
* [PEP8](http://pep8online.com) and AUTOPEP8
* The website was tested on the following browsers:
    * Safari
    * Google Chrome
    * Mozilla Firefox
    * Internet Explorer

### Further testing:

I asked my family and friends for any issues they could find and what the page looked and felt like on their mobile and desktop devices. All the issues they found were fixed and tested again.

## Bugs: üêû

#### Bugs During Development: 


Developing this project while being new to Python Django, I encountered errors along the way that proved to be somewhat challenging and it took me 
longer to find solutions and fixes.

<strong>Editing Blog</strong>

* <strong>Bug:</strong> üêû During Development i had an issue in the url pk=post.id as hard time getting the POST data from the form.
 
* <strong>Fix:</strong> üõ† As I'm new in using Django, After a lot of research, i had a mix up in the urls and views as i used blog.id. To fix it i read the view code line by one to where i had a mistake and found i used blog.id not post.id. 
* <strong>Verdict:</strong> ‚úÖ This bug was squashed and I could continue working on other aspects of the project.
